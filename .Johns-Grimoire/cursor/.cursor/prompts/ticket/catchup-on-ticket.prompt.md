# Catch Up on Ticket (Pattern-Based)

This prompt provides a narrative summary of ticket history, key decisions, and current state for quick onboarding after time away or when joining work in progress.

**Pattern**: Ticket Catchup Pattern ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐  
**Effectiveness**: Essential for context continuity  
**Use When**: Returning to ticket after time away, joining someone else's work, need quick orientation

---

## Required Context

- **Ticket ID**: Valid ticket identifier (e.g., EBASE-12345, EPP-192)
- **Ticket Documentation**: plan.md, progress.md, context.md must exist
- **Optional**: Intensity level (quick/standard/comprehensive)
- **Optional**: Focus area (decisions, implementations, blockers, timeline)

---

## Process

Follow these steps to get a ticket catchup:

### Step 1: Identify Your Catchup Need
Determine what intensity you need:
- **Quick**: 1-2 minute read, executive summary only
- **Standard**: 3-5 minute read, narrative with key points
- **Comprehensive**: 10+ minute read, full narrative with all details

### Step 2: Formulate Catchup Request
Use canonical XML schema:
```xml
<ticket>
  <id>@[TICKET-ID]</id>
  <action>catch me up</action>
  <intensity>[LEVEL]</intensity> <!-- optional: quick | standard | comprehensive -->
</ticket>
```

Shorthand (supported):
```text
<ticket><id>@[TICKET-ID]</id><action>catch me up</action><intensity>[LEVEL]</intensity></ticket>
```

### Step 3: Add Optional Focus (if needed)
Specify what aspect to emphasize:
```
<ticket><id>@[TICKET-ID]</id><action>catch me up</action><context>Focus: [ASPECT]</context></ticket>
```

### Step 4: Provide Time Context (if helpful)
Mention how long you've been away:
```
<ticket><id>@[TICKET-ID]</id><action>catch me up</action><context>Away: [DURATION]</context></ticket>
```

### Step 5: Review Narrative Summary
Read the AI's catchup narrative to understand ticket history and current state.

### Step 6: Proceed with Work or Ask Questions
Either continue work or ask clarifying questions about specific aspects.

## Reasoning Process (for AI Agent)

When this prompt is invoked, the AI should:

1. **Load All Ticket Files**: Read plan.md, progress.md, context.md, timeline.md, references.md
2. **Extract Key Narrative**: Identify what happened chronologically (synthesize from progress.md)
3. **Highlight Decisions**: Surface important decisions and their rationale (why, not just what)
4. **Summarize Discoveries**: Note key findings and breakthroughs that changed approach
5. **Explain Current State**: Why are we where we are now? (context for current.md state)
6. **Orient for Next Steps**: What user needs to know before continuing
7. **Provide Reading Pointers**: Link to detailed sections if user wants to dig deeper
8. **Structure by Intensity**: Adjust detail level based on quick/standard/comprehensive request

---

## Basic Usage

```
<ticket><id>@[TICKET-ID]</id><action>catch me up</action></ticket>
```

**Placeholder Conventions**:
- `[TICKET-ID]` - Ticket identifier in format PROJ-NUMBER (e.g., EBASE-12345, RULES-001, EPP-192)
- `[LEVEL]` - Intensity level: quick | standard | comprehensive
- `[ASPECT]` - Focus area: decisions | implementations | blockers | timeline
- `[DURATION]` - Time away: "a week", "2 weeks", "since Phase 1"

---

**AI delivers**: Executive summary with 3 key points and next step

### Standard Catchup (3-5 minutes to read)
```
<ticket><id>@[TICKET-ID]</id><action>catch me up</action></ticket>
```

---

## Catchup Focus Areas

### Decision-Focused Catchup
```
<ticket><id>@[TICKET-ID]</id><action>catch me up</action><context>Focus: key decisions</context></ticket>
```
**AI emphasizes**: Why choices were made, alternatives considered, rationale

### Implementation-Focused Catchup
```
<ticket><id>@[TICKET-ID]</id><action>catch me up</action><context>Focus: what's been implemented</context></ticket>
```

```
**AI emphasizes**: Problems encountered, solutions applied, remaining obstacles

### Timeline-Focused Catchup
```
<ticket><id>@[TICKET-ID]</id><action>catch me up</action><context>Focus: timeline</context></ticket>
```
**AI emphasizes**: When things happened, session boundaries, work patterns

## Common Catchup Requests

```

## Catchup vs Status Check

### Use **Catchup** When:
- ✅ You've been away from the ticket
- ✅ You need to understand what happened (the story)
- ✅ You want narrative context with decisions and why
- ✅ Joining someone else's work
- ✅ Need to understand rationale behind current state

### Use **Status Check** When:
- ✅ You're actively working on the ticket
- ✅ You need to know what's left to do
- ✅ You want structured progress report (not narrative)
- ✅ Preparing for next action
- ✅ Need completion percentages and remaining work

**Key Difference**: 
- **Catchup** = storytelling (what happened and why)
- **Status** = reporting (where we are and what's left)

---

## Quality Criteria

A good catchup response should have:

- [ ] Narrative flow (tells the story, not just lists facts)
- [ ] Key decisions highlighted with rationale (why, not just what)
- [ ] Important discoveries noted with impact (what changed because of this)
- [ ] Current state explained (why we're here, not just that we are)
- [ ] Context for next steps provided (what to know before continuing)
- [ ] Blockers/issues surfaced with status
- [ ] Reading time appropriate to requested level (quick: 1-2min, standard: 3-5min, comprehensive: 10+min)
- [ ] References to detailed files provided for deep dives
- [ ] No need to ask follow-up "why" questions (context complete)
- [ ] Chronological clarity (when things happened in relation to each other)

---

## Tips

- Use "catch me up" as explicit trigger phrase
- Specify intensity level (quick/standard/comprehensive) if you have time constraints
- Mention how long you've been away for better context calibration
- Request focus areas if you only care about specific aspects
- Great for Monday mornings or after vacations
- Perfect when joining collaborative tickets
- Essential for handover situations
- Combine with status check after catchup: "Now check current status"

---

## Follow-up Patterns

After catchup, typically:

1. **Proceed with Work**
   ```
   <ticket><id>@[TICKET-ID]</id><action>please continue</action></ticket>
   ```

2. **Ask Specific Questions**
   ```
   Why did we choose approach X over Y? [based on catchup understanding]
   ```

3. **Validate Understanding**
   ```
   Based on the catchup, I think next step is Y - correct?
   ```

4. **Transition to Status**
   ```
   <ticket><id>@[TICKET-ID]</id><action>now check current status</action></ticket>
   ```
   → Transition from history (catchup) to current state (status)
