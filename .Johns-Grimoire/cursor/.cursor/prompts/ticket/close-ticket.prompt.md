# Close Ticket

Please close the specified ticket by validating completion, creating a recap summary, and finalizing all documentation.

**Pattern**: Ticket Closure Pattern ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐  
**Effectiveness**: Ensures clean, documented ticket closure  
**Use When**: Work complete and ready to formalize closure

---

## Purpose

This prompt ensures proper ticket closure by:
- Validating all acceptance criteria met
- Creating comprehensive recap documentation
- Finalizing progress and context
- Preparing commit message
- Cleaning up current ticket reference

Use this when work is complete and you're ready to formally close a ticket.

---

## Required Context

- **Ticket ID**: Ticket to close (or "current ticket" to close active ticket)
- **Ticket Documentation**: plan.md, progress.md, context.md, tracker.md must exist
- **Completion State**: All work items must be complete

---

## Process

Follow these steps to close a ticket:

### Step 1: Verify Readiness
Ensure ticket work is complete:
- All acceptance criteria met
- No open blockers
- Tests passing
- Documentation complete

### Step 2: Formulate Closure Request
Use pattern with XML delimiters:
```xml
<ticket>
  <id>@[TICKET-ID]</id>
  <action>close ticket</action>
</ticket>
```

Shorthand (supported):
```
<ticket><id>@[TICKET-ID]</id><action>close ticket</action></ticket>
```

Or for current ticket:
```xml
<ticket>
  <action>close ticket</action>
</ticket>
```

### Step 3: Review Validation Report
AI will validate completion and report status (ready to close or blockers found).

### Step 4: Review Generated Artifacts
Check AI-created artifacts:
- `recap.md` summary
- Final progress entry
- Git commit message

### Step 5: Commit and Archive
Use provided commit message to commit ticket documentation and close ticket.

## Reasoning Process (for AI Agent)

When this prompt is invoked, the AI **MUST** follow this strict process:

### Step 0: Self-Validation (MANDATORY FIRST STEP)

**Before proceeding with closure, AI MUST validate**:

```markdown
## Pre-Closure Self-Check

Before I close this ticket, I MUST verify:

- [ ] I have READ plan.md and identified ALL acceptance criteria
- [ ] I have VERIFIED each acceptance criterion is met with evidence
- [ ] I have CHECKED for blockers in context.md
- [ ] I have CONFIRMED all tests pass (if applicable)
- [ ] I have REVIEWED code quality meets standards
- [ ] I would feel confident handing this to a colleague saying "it's done"

**If ANY checkbox is unchecked, I MUST NOT proceed with closure.**
**If ANY acceptance criteria is not met, I MUST BLOCK closure and report remaining work.**
```

### Step 1: Validate Completion

Read and verify:
```
tickets/[TICKET-ID]/plan.md         → Check ALL acceptance criteria
tickets/[TICKET-ID]/tracker.md      → Verify 100% completion (if exists)
tickets/[TICKET-ID]/context.md      → Confirm no blockers
tickets/[TICKET-ID]/progress.md     → Review work completion
```

**Critical**: If ANY acceptance criteria not met, STOP and BLOCK closure.

### Step 2: Create Recap

Generate `tickets/[TICKET-ID]/recap.md` (see Recap Template below).

### Step 3: Final Progress Entry

Append to `tickets/[TICKET-ID]/progress.md`:

```markdown
### [TIMESTAMP] - Ticket Closed

#### Final Status
- ✅ All acceptance criteria met
- ✅ All deliverables completed
- ✅ Documentation finalized
- ✅ Quality targets achieved

#### Closure Summary
[Brief summary of what was accomplished]

#### Metrics
- Duration: [Time spent]
- Completion: 100%
- Quality: [Meets/Exceeds standards]

**Ticket CLOSED**: Ready for commit and archival
```

### Step 4: Generate Commit Message

Create commit message following standards (see Commit Message Template below).

### Step 5: Cleanup

If this is the current ticket:
- Clear `tickets/current.md` (or update to next ticket)
- Confirm ticket folder is complete

## Examples (Few-Shot)

See exemplar for complete worked examples:
- `.cursor/prompts/exemplars/ticket/ticket-closure-exemplar.md`

## Anti-Patterns

### ❌ DON'T: Close with incomplete work

```
Acceptance criteria: 3/5 met
- [x] Feature implemented
- [x] Tests added
- [ ] Documentation missing  ← BLOCKER
- [ ] Performance issue unresolved  ← BLOCKER
- [ ] Code review not done  ← BLOCKER
```

**Why bad**: Incomplete tickets create technical debt, confusion for future work, and violate completion discipline.

**Fix**: Complete all acceptance criteria OR update plan.md if requirements changed legitimately.

### ❌ DON'T: Skip recap

**Why bad**: Future reference lost, learnings not captured, handoff difficult, no record of outcomes.

**Fix**: Always create recap.md before closing. No exceptions.

### ❌ DON'T: Close without validation

**Why bad**: May miss incomplete work, quality issues, or blockers.

**Fix**: Always run validation checklist first (Step 0: Self-Validation).

### ❌ DON'T: Rush closure

**Why bad**: Premature "done" claims damage trust and create rework.

**Fix**: Act as responsible colleague. Would you confidently hand this off saying "it's complete"?

## Quality Criteria

A proper ticket closure should have:

- [ ] **All acceptance criteria validated**: 100% met with evidence
- [ ] **No blockers remaining**: All issues resolved
- [ ] **Recap.md created**: Comprehensive outcomes summary
- [ ] **Final progress entry added**: Closure documented
- [ ] **Commit message generated**: Following standards
- [ ] **Cleanup completed**: current.md cleared if applicable
- [ ] **Self-validation performed**: AI verified completion before proceeding
- [ ] **RCA completed** (if bug fix ticket): Root cause analysis documented
- [ ] **Follow-up tickets created** (if needed): Future work captured

---

## Usage

**Close current ticket**:
```
<ticket><action>close ticket</action></ticket>
```

**Close specific ticket**:
```
<ticket><id>@EBASE-12345</id><action>close ticket</action></ticket>
```

**Close with validation check first**:
```
<ticket><id>@EBASE-12345</id><action>validate completion, then close</action></ticket>
```
