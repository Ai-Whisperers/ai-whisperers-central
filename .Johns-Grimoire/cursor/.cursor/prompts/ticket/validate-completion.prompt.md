# Validate Ticket Completion

Please perform comprehensive validation to determine if a ticket is truly complete and ready to close.

**Pattern**: Completion Validation Pattern ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐  
**Effectiveness**: Critical quality gate - prevents premature "done" claims  
**Use When**: Before claiming any ticket complete, before closing tickets

---

## Purpose

This prompt enforces completion discipline by:
- Systematically verifying all acceptance criteria met
- Checking code quality and testing standards
- Validating documentation completeness
- Ensuring no regressions or breaking changes
- Preventing premature "done" claims
- Acting as quality gate before closure

Use this before claiming any ticket complete or marking it ready to close.

---

## Required Context

```xml
<ticket>
  <id>[TICKET_ID]</id>
  <action>validate completion</action>
</ticket>
```

**Placeholder Conventions**:
- `[TICKET_ID]` - Ticket identifier (e.g., EPP-192, EBASE-12345) or "current ticket"

---

## Process

Follow these steps to validate ticket completion:

### Step 1: Identify Ticket to Validate
Determine which ticket to validate (current or specific ticket ID).

### Step 2: Formulate Validation Request
Use pattern with XML delimiters:
```xml
<ticket>
  <id>[TICKET_ID]</id>
  <action>validate completion</action>
</ticket>
```

Or for current ticket:
```xml
<ticket>
  <action>validate completion</action>
</ticket>
```

### Step 3: Review Validation Report
AI will perform comprehensive 10-category validation and provide detailed report with evidence.

### Step 4: Address Issues (if any)
If validation fails:
- Fix blockers first (must be resolved)
- Address must-fix items (should be resolved)
- Consider nice-to-have items (can be follow-up tickets)

### Step 5: Re-Validate After Fixes
Run validation again after addressing issues.

### Step 6: Proceed to Closure (if validated)
Only after validation passes, proceed with close-ticket.

## Reasoning Process (for AI Agent)

When this prompt is invoked, the AI should:

1. **Load Ticket Context**: Read plan.md (acceptance criteria), progress.md (what was done), context.md (current state)
2. **Verify Requirements**: Check each acceptance criterion against actual deliverables with evidence
3. **Assess Quality**: Review code, tests, documentation against standards (10 categories)
4. **Check for Gaps**: Look for incomplete work, missing tests, undocumented decisions
5. **Evaluate Readiness**: Can this be closed without follow-up work? (honest assessment)
6. **Surface Issues**: Identify and categorize by severity (BLOCKER/MUST-FIX/NICE-TO-HAVE)
7. **Generate Report**: Provide comprehensive validation report with evidence and recommendation
8. **Act as Responsible Colleague**: Would you confidently hand this to another developer saying "it's done"? If not, flag issues.

- [ ] Clear recommendation (Ready or Not Ready to close)
- [ ] Next steps provided with priority order
- [ ] No false positives (claiming pass when criteria not met)
- [ ] No false negatives (claiming fail for actually met criteria)
- [ ] Honest assessment (act as responsible colleague)

## Anti-Patterns

### ❌ DON'T: Claim complete with known issues
```markdown
Status: Ready to close
(But 2 repositories missing, no edge case tests)
```
**Why bad**: Premature completion creates technical debt, misleads stakeholders, damages trust

✅ **DO: Honest assessment with remaining work**
```markdown
Status: NOT ready to close
Blockers: 2 repositories missing (CalendarEntry, CalendarDate)
Blockers: Edge case tests needed (null IDs, concurrent access)
Estimated work: 3 hours
```

### ❌ DON'T: Vague validation
```markdown
Looks good, ready to close.
[No details, no evidence]
```
**Why bad**: No evidence of systematic check, can't catch real issues

✅ **DO: Systematic validation with evidence**
```markdown
Category 1: Requirements Met ✅ PASS
- ✅ All 14 repositories implemented
- ✅ UnitOfWork pattern integrated
Evidence: Code review shows all files present, functional tests passing
```

### ❌ DON'T: Ignore objective blockers
```markdown
2 repositories missing, but good enough to close
```
**Why bad**: Acceptance criteria explicitly not met, unprofessional

✅ **DO: Respect acceptance criteria**
```markdown
2 repositories missing → BLOCKER
Acceptance criteria requires 14, only 12 present
NOT READY TO CLOSE until all 14 implemented
```

---

## Critical Rules

**🚫 DO NOT claim completion if**:
- Any acceptance criteria unmet (even one)
- Blockers exist (high-risk issues)
- Tests failing (any test failures)
- Documentation incomplete (required docs missing)
- Code quality issues present (linting errors, code smells)

**✅ Act as responsible colleague**: 
If you wouldn't feel confident handing this to another developer saying "it's done", it's NOT done. Be honest about remaining work.

## Usage

**Validate current ticket**:
```xml
<ticket><action>validate completion</action></ticket>
```

**Validate specific ticket**:
```xml
<ticket>
  <id>EBASE-12345</id>
</ticket>
<action>validate completion</action>
```

**Before closing (recommended workflow)**:
```xml
<!-- Step 1: Validate -->
<ticket><id>EPP-192</id><action>validate completion</action></ticket>

<!-- Step 2: Review validation report -->
<!-- Step 3: If passes, close -->
<ticket><id>EPP-192</id><action>close ticket</action></ticket>
```
