# Find Prompts Needing Review

Please scan the prompt library and identify prompts that need review based on quality criteria, integration status, and maintenance requirements.

**Pattern**: Quality Assurance Pattern ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Effectiveness**: Critical for maintaining prompt library quality and preventing technical debt
**Use When**: Need to identify prompts requiring attention or improvement

---

## Enhancement Decision Tree

```
Need to assess prompt library health?
├─ YES → Continue with this prompt
└─ NO → Use specific prompt improvement tools

What type of assessment needed?
├─ Quality standards compliance → @find-prompts-needing-review quality
├─ Collection integration status → @find-prompts-needing-review integration
├─ Maintenance and updates → @find-prompts-needing-review maintenance
└─ Complete health check → @find-prompts-needing-review all

Planning improvements?
├─ YES → Use results to prioritize improvement tickets
├─ NO → Use for monitoring only

Found issues to fix?
├─ Critical (YAML, missing fields) → Fix immediately, then commit
├─ Important (examples, structure) → Create improvement tickets
└─ Maintenance (consistency) → Address in next maintenance cycle
```

## Purpose

Identify prompts requiring review to ensure the prompt library maintains high quality and standards. This includes:
- Quality compliance checks
- Integration verification
- Maintenance and update needs
- Technical debt identification
- Improvement opportunities

---

## Required Context

- **Review Focus** (optional): Specific area to focus on
  - `quality`: Frontmatter and content standards
  - `integration`: Collection and reference completeness
  - `maintenance`: Updates, fixes, and technical debt
  - `all`: Comprehensive review (default)
- **Include Uncommitted**: Always include uncommitted prompt files (highest priority for review)

---

## Process

1. **Scan Prompt Library**
   - Examine all `.prompt.md` files in `.cursor/prompts/`
   - **Include uncommitted changes**: Check `git status` for staged/unstaged prompt files
   - Parse frontmatter and content structure for all files (committed and uncommitted)

2. **Apply Review Criteria**
   - Check frontmatter completeness and format
   - Validate content structure and quality
   - Verify collection integration
   - Assess maintenance status

3. **Categorize Issues**
   - **Critical**: Breaking issues requiring immediate fix
   - **Important**: Quality issues affecting usability
   - **Maintenance**: Updates and improvements needed

4. **Prioritize Findings**
   - Sort by severity and impact
   - Group by category and type
   - Identify quick wins vs major efforts

5. **Generate Report**
   - Detailed findings with specific issues
   - Actionable recommendations
   - Priority assignments

---

## Reasoning Process (for AI Agent)

When evaluating prompts for review:

1. **Quality First**: Critical issues (missing frontmatter, broken YAML) take priority
2. **Impact Assessment**: Consider how issues affect usability and maintenance
3. **Effort Estimation**: Balance severity with fix complexity
4. **Standards Compliance**: Ensure alignment with prompt creation and registry rules
5. **Maintenance Burden**: Identify prompts causing ongoing maintenance overhead

---

## Review Criteria

### Quality Issues
- **Frontmatter**: Missing required fields, invalid YAML, incorrect format
- **Content**: Missing sections, unclear instructions, poor examples
- **Standards**: Not following prompt creation rules
- **Documentation**: Missing references, outdated information

### Integration Issues
- **Collections**: Not included in appropriate collection manifests
- **References**: Missing cross-references to related prompts/rules
- **Registry**: Incompatible with Prompt Registry format
- **Dependencies**: Broken links or invalid references

### Maintenance Issues
- **Age**: Long time since last update (potential staleness)
- **Usage**: Low usage indicators or outdated patterns
- **Technical Debt**: Accumulated issues not addressed
- **Consistency**: Not aligned with current standards
