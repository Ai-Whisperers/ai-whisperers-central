# Find Recently Added Prompts

Please scan the prompt library and identify prompts that have been recently added or modified within the specified time period.

**Pattern**: Maintenance Tracking Pattern ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Effectiveness**: Essential for tracking prompt library evolution and identifying new additions
**Use When**: Need to review recent prompt additions or track library growth

---

## Purpose

Identify prompts that have been recently added to the prompt library to:
- Track new prompt development and contributions
- Review recent additions for quality and consistency
- Monitor prompt library growth and activity
- Ensure new prompts follow standards and are properly integrated

---

## Required Context

- **Time Period**: How far back to check (e.g., `7d`, `30d`, `90d`)
- **Optional**: Specific categories to focus on
- **Optional**: Include/exclude certain types of changes (additions vs modifications)
**Optional**: Filter by category, author, or complexity level
**Optional**: Output format preference (markdown, json, csv)

---

## Process

1. **Scan Prompt Directory**
   - Examine `.cursor/prompts/` folder structure
   - Identify all `.prompt.md` files recursively
   - **Include uncommitted changes**: Check git status for staged/unstaged prompt files

2. **Check Modification Times**
   - Get file modification timestamps from filesystem
   - Check git commit history for committed changes
   - **Prioritize uncommitted files**: Files not yet in git are "most recent"
   - Filter by specified time period (filesystem timestamps for uncommitted, git timestamps for committed)
   - Sort by most recent first

3. **Analyze Changes**
   - Determine if additions vs modifications
   - Check for proper integration (collections, references)
   - Identify potential quality concerns

4. **Categorize Findings**
   - Group by category/type
   - Flag potential review candidates
   - Prioritize critical items

5. **Report Results**
   - List recently added/modified prompts
   - Provide actionable insights
   - Suggest next steps

## Decision Tree for Complex Analysis

```
Found recent prompts?
├─ YES → Continue to categorization
│   ├─ Include uncommitted? → Flag as "very recent" (not yet in git)
│   └─ Only committed → Proceed normally
└─ NO → Check uncommitted changes first
    ├─ Uncommitted files exist → Include them as recent additions
    ├─ No uncommitted files → Check time period
    │   ├─ Too short? → Extend period (try 90d)
    │   └─ Library inactive? → Check git activity
    │       ├─ No recent commits → Library maintenance needed
    │       └─ Commits exist → Check file patterns
    └─ Time period OK → No recent activity

Prompts need review?
├─ YES → Prioritize by category
│   ├─ Critical (missing collections) → Immediate action required
│   ├─ High (new workflows) → Schedule review within 1 week
│   ├─ Medium (enhancements) → Review within 2 weeks
│   └─ Low (minor updates) → Optional review
└─ NO → Generate summary report
    ├─ Export available? → Choose format (markdown/json/csv)
    └─ Automation needed? → Configure monitoring mode

Integration issues found?
├─ YES → Create remediation plan
│   ├─ Critical issues → Immediate fixes required
│   ├─ Multiple issues → Batch processing approach
│   └─ Structural issues → Comprehensive review needed
└─ NO → Quality assessment complete
    ├─ High quality → Consider as exemplars
    ├─ Standard quality → No action needed
    └─ Quality issues → Improvement recommended
```

## Reasoning Process (for AI Agent)

When analyzing recent prompt additions:

1. **Understand Scope**: What constitutes "recent" based on the time period
2. **Prioritize Quality**: New prompts need immediate review for standards compliance
3. **Track Integration**: Ensure new prompts are properly added to collections and referenced
4. **Identify Patterns**: Look for trends in prompt development and potential gaps
5. **Suggest Actions**: Provide clear next steps for review and integration

## Quality Criteria

- [ ] All prompt files scanned within time period
- [ ] File modification times accurately retrieved
- [ ] Proper categorization by addition vs modification
- [ ] Collection integration status verified
- [ ] Clear prioritization for review needs
- [ ] Actionable recommendations provided

---

## Usage

**Basic usage** (last 30 days):
```
@find-recently-added-prompts 30d
```

**Specific time period**:
```
@find-recently-added-prompts 7d
```

**With category focus**:
```
@find-recently-added-prompts 90d --category agile
```

---

## Troubleshooting

**Issue**: No prompts found in time period
**Cause**: Time period too short, no recent activity, or only uncommitted changes
**Solution**: Extend time period (try 90d instead of 7d), check git status for uncommitted files, or verify if prompt library has recent commits

**Issue**: File access errors
**Cause**: Permission issues or git repository problems
**Solution**: Ensure proper access to `.cursor/prompts/` directory and verify git repository is clean

**Issue**: Incorrect timestamps
**Cause**: System clock differences or git operations affecting file timestamps
**Solution**: Use git log timestamps as backup verification: `git log --since="30 days ago" --name-only --pretty=format: .cursor/prompts/`

**Issue**: Missing collection integration status
**Cause**: Collection manifest not found or parsing error
**Solution**: Verify `.cursor/prompts/collections/` exists and manifests use `.collection.yml` extension

**Issue**: Performance issues with large time periods
**Cause**: Scanning too many files or deep directory traversal
**Solution**: Limit to specific categories with `--category` flag or reduce time period scope

**Issue**: False positives in modification detection
**Cause**: File timestamps changed by non-content operations (permissions, moves)
**Solution**: Cross-reference with git log to verify actual content changes

## Validation Checklist

Before finalizing the analysis report:

- [ ] **Time period validation**: Specified period produces meaningful results (not too short/long)
- [ ] **File scanning completeness**: All `.prompt.md` files in scope were examined
- [ ] **Timestamp accuracy**: File modification times are reliable (cross-checked with git if needed)
- [ ] **Categorization accuracy**: Prompts correctly classified as additions vs modifications
- [ ] **Integration status verified**: Collection membership checked for all prompts
- [ ] **Prioritization logic**: Critical items flagged appropriately based on impact
- [ ] **Output format consistency**: Report structure matches expected format
- [ ] **Actionable recommendations**: Next steps are specific and achievable
- [ ] **Performance optimized**: Large libraries processed efficiently
- [ ] **Error handling**: Edge cases (permissions, missing files) handled gracefully

## Performance Considerations

### For Large Prompt Libraries (>100 prompts)

**Optimization Strategies**:
- Use `--batch` mode for parallel processing
- Limit time periods to recent activity (7-30 days)
- Filter by category to reduce scope
- Use `--output json` for faster processing
- Consider incremental scanning for monitoring

**Expected Performance**:
- Small library (<50 prompts): <5 seconds
- Medium library (50-200 prompts): 10-30 seconds
- Large library (>200 prompts): 30-60 seconds with batch mode

**Memory Usage**: Linear scaling with prompt count, typically <50MB for 1000 prompts
