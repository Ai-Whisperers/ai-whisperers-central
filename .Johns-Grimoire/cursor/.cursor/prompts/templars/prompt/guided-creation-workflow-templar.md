# Guided Multi-Step Creation Workflow Templar

## Pattern Purpose

This template provides a structured, guided workflow for creation tasks where users need step-by-step assistance with decisions at each stage. It reduces cognitive load by breaking complex creation into manageable steps with clear decision points.

## When to Use

Use this pattern when creating prompts for:
- **Setup/initialization tasks** - Project setup, environment configuration
- **Artifact creation** - Creating structured documents, files, or objects
- **Wizard-style workflows** - Multi-step processes requiring decisions
- **Onboarding flows** - Guiding users through complex first-time tasks
- **Migration tasks** - Step-by-step migration with validation

**Criteria for This Pattern**:
- ✅ Task has 4+ distinct steps
- ✅ Users need guidance at each step
- ✅ Decisions required at multiple points
- ✅ Output quality depends on following structure
- ✅ Process can be templated/standardized

**Decision Tree Format** (if applicable):
```
[Question]?
├─ [Answer A] → [Recommendation]

**Examples**:
- ✅ `[good-example]` - [Why good]
- ✅ `[another-good-example]` - [Why good]
- ❌ `[bad-example]` - [Why bad]
- ❌ `[another-bad-example]` - [Why bad]

### Step 4: [Write/Configure Phase 1]

**[Configuration Aspect 1]**:

```markdown
# [Section 1]

[Content guidance]

## [Section 2]

[Content guidance]

## [Section 3]

[Content guidance]
```

**Enhanced Structure** (Recommended):
```markdown
# [Section 1]

[Enhanced guidance]

## [Section 2]

[Enhanced guidance with subsections]

### [Subsection 2.1]
[Details]

### [Subsection 2.2]
[Details]

## [Section 3]

[Enhanced guidance]
```

### Step 6: [Validate/Test Phase]

1. **[Validation 1]**: [How to validate]
2. **[Validation 2]**: [How to validate]
3. **[Validation 3]**: [How to validate]
4. **[Validation 4]**: [How to validate]

## [Artifact] Template

[Provide complete template showing all sections filled with placeholders]

```[format]
[Complete example template with placeholders and annotations]
```

## Examples (Few-Shot)

### Example 1: [Scenario 1 - Complete Workflow]

**Request**: "[Example user request]"

**Step 1 - [Phase 1 Name]**:
- [Decision 1]: [Result]
- [Decision 2]: [Result]
- [Decision 3]: [Result]

**Step 2 - [Phase 2 Name]**:
- [Decision]: [Result with reasoning]

**Step 3 - [Phase 3 Name]**:
- [Configuration]: [Result]
- [Rationale]: [Why this choice]

**Step 4 - [Phase 4 Name]**:
```[format]
[Configuration example filled in]
```

**Step 5 - [Phase 5 Name]** (abbreviated):
```markdown
[Content example showing structure]
```

**Step 6 - [Phase 6 Name]**:
```
[Validation commands/checks shown]

Result: [Pass/Fail with details]
```

**Final Output**: `[path/to/created/artifact]`

### Example 2: [Scenario 2 - Alternative Path]

You: [User provides input]

AI: [Second question based on answer]
You: [User provides input]

[AI generates complete artifact]

## Customization Points

### Step 1: Define Phase
**Placeholder**: `[Reasoning Step N]`  
**Guidance**: Replace with specific questions users should answer about their creation task. Focus on purpose, audience, use cases, and expected output.

### Step 2: Choose Phase
**Placeholder**: `[Option Category]`, `[option-1]`, etc.  
**Guidance**: Replace with actual options/categories users choose from. Include decision trees if choices are complex.

### Step 3: Name/Configure Phase
**Placeholder**: `[Configuration Rules]`  
**Guidance**: Replace with specific naming conventions, formatting rules, or configuration constraints for your domain.

### Step 4-5: Write/Configure Phases
**Placeholder**: `[Configuration Aspect]`, `[Section N]`  
**Guidance**: Replace with actual configuration fields or content sections users need to complete.

### Step 6: Validate Phase
**Placeholder**: `[Validation N]`  
**Guidance**: Replace with specific validation checks, quality gates, or testing steps.

### Examples Section
**Placeholder**: `[Scenario N]`  
**Guidance**: Provide 2-3 concrete walkthroughs showing complete workflows from request to final output.

## Example Usage (Applying This Templar)

### Creating a "Setup Development Environment" Prompt

**Step 1 - Define**: Environment setup for new developers  
**Step 2 - Choose**: Category = `setup/`, Platform = Windows/Linux/Mac  
**Step 3 - Name**: `setup-dev-environment.prompt.md`  
**Step 4 - Configure Frontmatter**: Add platform detection logic  
**Step 5 - Write Content**: Installation steps, verification commands  
**Step 6 - Validate**: Test on fresh machine

**Result**: Guided workflow helping new developers set up their environment step-by-step with platform-specific instructions.

## Best Practices

### DO
- ✅ Provide clear decision criteria at each step
- ✅ Include good/bad examples throughout
- ✅ Offer both interactive and direct invocation modes
- ✅ Validate output at the end
- ✅ Include complete template users can copy
- ✅ Show 2+ full workflow examples

### DON'T
- ❌ Skip steps or compress too much
- ❌ Make users guess at decisions
- ❌ Provide vague examples
- ❌ Skip validation step
- ❌ Assume users know the conventions

## Success Metrics

Good application of this pattern achieves:
- **Completion rate**: >90% of users complete all steps
- **Quality**: Outputs meet standards without iteration
- **Efficiency**: Clear path reduces time to completion
- **Confidence**: Users feel guided, not lost
- **Reusability**: Template works across similar creation tasks
