# Create Technical Feature for [Epic]

**Pattern**: Technical Enabler Documentation ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | **Effectiveness**: High | **Use When**: Documenting infrastructure, architecture, or technical work that enables business features

Create a well-structured Agile Technical Feature documentation file (Enabler).

## Purpose

Generate comprehensive Technical Feature (Enabler) documentation that captures architectural decisions, infrastructure changes, refactoring efforts, or technical improvements that enable business features. Technical Features focus on HOW the system works (technical implementation) rather than WHAT users can do (functional capabilities).

**Required Context**:

- `[PARENT_EPIC]`: The Epic this feature supports.
- `[FEATURE_TITLE]`: Name of the technical enabler.
- `[TECHNICAL_GOAL]`: The architectural or infrastructural outcome.
- `[BENEFICIARY]`: Usually developers, system, or future features.

## User Process

1. **Gather Context**: Identify parent Epic, technical goal, and beneficiary (which features/systems benefit)
2. **Invoke Prompt**: Provide Epic context, feature title, and technical objective
3. **Review Generated Feature**: Validate architecture design and implementation plan
4. **Refine Technical Details**: Adjust design diagrams, technology choices, and implementation phases
5. **Technical Review**: Present to architecture team for validation
6. **Commit Documentation**: Save to `docs/agile/features/` with appropriate naming

## Reasoning Process (for AI Agent)

1. **Identify Enabler Goal**: Categorize as architecture, infrastructure, refactoring, performance, security, or compliance work
2. **Define Architecture**: Describe the technical design, patterns, technology stack, and architectural changes
3. **Assess Impact**: Identify which systems, components, or Business Features are affected or enabled
4. **Plan Implementation**: Outline high-level phases (design/spike, implementation, cutover/migration)
5. **Break Down into Tasks**: Identify technical tasks, spikes, or technical stories required
6. **Validate Completeness**: Ensure architecture diagrams, implementation plan, and technical acceptance criteria are clear

## Process

1. **Feature Identifier**:
   - Format: `TECH-[Domain]-[Name]`
   - Example: `TECH-CORE-MIGRATION`

2. **Overview**:
   - Description of technical work.
   - Link to Parent Epic.
   - Supported Business Features (why are we doing this?).

3. **Technical Objectives**:
   - Specific technical outcomes (e.g., "Reduce API latency by 50ms").

4. **Architecture & Design**:
   - Diagrams (Mermaid).
   - Pattern descriptions.
   - Technology stack changes.

5. **Implementation Plan**:
   - Phase 1: Prototype/Spike.
   - Phase 2: Implementation.
   - Phase 3: Cutover.

6. **Dependencies**:
   - Library updates, infrastructure provisioning.

7. **Acceptance Criteria (Technical)**:
   - Performance benchmarks met.
   - Code coverage requirements.
   - Documentation completed.

## Examples (Few-Shot)

### Example 1: Data Warehouse Infrastructure

**Input**:
```
Epic: EPIC-MODERN-REPORTING (Modernize Reporting Infrastructure)
Feature Title: Data Warehouse Setup
Technical Goal: Centralize sales and finance data with sub-second query performance
Beneficiary: Sales Dashboard (FEAT-RPT-SALES-DASH), Finance Dashboard (FEAT-RPT-FINANCE-DASH)
```

**AI Reasoning**:
- Enabler type: Infrastructure (new data warehouse)
- Technical objective: Centralized data store with fast query performance
- Architecture: Snowflake cloud data warehouse, ETL pipelines from source systems
- Supported features: All reporting dashboards depend on this foundation
- Implementation phases: Provision → Schema design → ETL → Testing → Cutover
- Acceptance criteria: Query performance, data accuracy, uptime SLA

**Output**:
```markdown
# Technical Feature: TECH-DATA-WAREHOUSE

## Parent Epic
EPIC-MODERN-REPORTING: Modernize Reporting Infrastructure

## Feature Identifier
TECH-DATA-WAREHOUSE: Data Warehouse Infrastructure Setup

## Overview
Provision and configure Snowflake cloud data warehouse as centralized data repository for all reporting dashboards. This technical enabler provides the foundational data layer required for real-time PowerBI reporting.

**Type**: Infrastructure Enabler  
**Supported Business Features**:
- FEAT-RPT-SALES-DASH (Sales Dashboard)
- FEAT-RPT-FINANCE-DASH (Finance Dashboard)
- FEAT-RPT-BOARD-REPORTS (Board Reporting)

## Technical Objectives
- **Primary**: Centralize sales and finance data in single queryable data warehouse
- **Performance**: Achieve sub-second query response time for 95% of dashboard queries
- **Scalability**: Support 5-year historical data (~10TB) with 50+ concurrent users
- **Reliability**: Maintain 99.9% uptime SLA with automated failover

## Architecture & Design

### High-Level Architecture

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Source Systems] -->|ETL| B[Snowflake DWH]
    B --> C[PowerBI]
    B --> D[Data Quality Monitoring]
    E[Schema Design] -.-> B
    F[IAM & Security] -.-> B
```

### Technology Stack
- **Data Warehouse**: Snowflake (X-Large warehouse, multi-cluster auto-scaling)
- **ETL Tool**: Apache Airflow + Snowflake connectors
- **Schema Design**: Star schema with fact and dimension tables
- **Security**: Row-level security, role-based access control
- **Monitoring**: Snowflake query performance monitoring, AWS CloudWatch

### Pattern Descriptions

**Star Schema Design**:
- **Fact Tables**: Sales transactions, financial entries (append-only)
- **Dimension Tables**: Products, customers, regions, dates (slowly changing dimensions Type 2)
- **Aggregation Tables**: Pre-computed daily/monthly rollups for performance

**Data Loading Strategy**:
- **Historical Load**: One-time bulk load of 5 years data (~10TB)
- **Incremental Load**: Nightly delta loads from source systems (changed records only)
- **Real-time Sync**: 5-minute micro-batch updates for sales transactions

### Technology Stack Changes
- **New**: Snowflake cloud data warehouse (replaces legacy on-premise SQL Server)
- **New**: Apache Airflow for ETL orchestration
- **Modified**: PowerBI connectivity (switch to Snowflake connector from SQL Server)
- **Retired**: Legacy Crystal Reports direct database connections

## Implementation Plan
