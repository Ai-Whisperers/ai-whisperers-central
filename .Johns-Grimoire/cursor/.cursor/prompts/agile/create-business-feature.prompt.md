# Create Business Feature for [Epic]

**Pattern**: Agile Documentation Generation ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | **Effectiveness**: High | **Use When**: Translating Epic-level initiatives into user-focused functional features

Create a well-structured Agile Business Feature documentation file.

## Purpose

Generate comprehensive Business Feature documentation that captures functional requirements from the user's perspective, linking Epic-level strategic goals to implementable User Stories. Business Features focus on WHAT users can do (functional capabilities) rather than HOW the system works (technical implementation).

**Required Context**:

- `[PARENT_EPIC]`: The Epic this feature belongs to.
- `[FEATURE_TITLE]`: Name of the feature.
- `[USER_VALUE]`: What the user gets out of this.
- `[TARGET_AUDIENCE]`: Who this is for.

## User Process

1. **Gather Context**: Identify parent Epic, user value proposition, and target audience
2. **Invoke Prompt**: Provide Epic context, feature title, and user value
3. **Review Generated Feature**: Validate alignment with Epic and business goals
4. **Refine Requirements**: Adjust functional requirements and user journeys as needed
5. **Create Child Stories**: Use generated feature as basis for breaking down into User Stories
6. **Commit Documentation**: Save to `docs/agile/features/` with appropriate naming

## Reasoning Process (for AI Agent)

1. **Link to Epic**: Ensure alignment with the parent Epic's goals and strategic objectives
2. **Define User Value**: Focus on the benefit to the end-user (functional requirements, not technical details)
3. **Outline User Flows**: Describe the primary user journeys and interaction points
4. **Draft Acceptance Criteria**: Define high-level criteria for feature acceptance (Definition of Done)
5. **Break Down into Stories**: Identify potential User Stories that implement this feature
6. **Validate Completeness**: Ensure all required sections are present and business value is clear

## Process

1. **Feature Identifier**:
   - Format: `FEAT-[Domain]-[Name]`
   - Example: `FEAT-AUTH-SSO`

2. **Overview**:
   - Description of functionality.
   - Link to Parent Epic.

3. **User Value Proposition**:
   - Why does the user need this?
   - "As a [role], I can [capability]..."

4. **User Journeys**:
   - Step-by-step flows.
   - Key interaction points.

5. **Functional Requirements**:
   - specific capabilities.
   - Business rules.

6. **Non-Functional Requirements**:
   - Performance, Security, Usability specific to this feature.

7. **Acceptance Criteria (Feature Level)**:
   - Definition of Done for the feature.

8. **Child Stories**:
   - List of User Stories (US-*) that make up this feature.

## Examples (Few-Shot)

### Example 1: Sales Dashboard Feature

**Input**:
```
Epic: EPIC-MODERN-REPORTING (Modernize Reporting Infrastructure)
Feature Title: Sales Dashboard
User Value: Sales managers need real-time visibility into daily sales performance
Target Audience: Sales managers, regional directors
```

**AI Reasoning**:
- Parent Epic focuses on replacing legacy Crystal Reports with modern PowerBI
- This feature delivers direct user value: real-time sales visibility
- Primary user journey: Login → Select region → View metrics → Export report
- Functional requirements: filtering, real-time data, export capabilities
- Can be broken into 3-4 user stories (setup data source, build dashboard, add filters, export)

**Output**:
```markdown
# Business Feature: FEAT-RPT-SALES-DASH

## Parent Epic
EPIC-MODERN-REPORTING: Modernize Reporting Infrastructure

## Overview
Interactive sales dashboard providing real-time visibility into daily sales performance across all regions. Replaces legacy monthly reports with live PowerBI dashboard.

## User Value Proposition
**As a** Sales Manager  
**I can** view real-time sales metrics filtered by region, product, and time period

- Secondary: Regional Directors, C-level executives

## User Journeys

### Journey 1: Daily Performance Review

2. Opens Sales Dashboard
3. Selects region filter (e.g., "Northeast")
4. Reviews key metrics: daily sales, top products, conversion rates
5. Identifies trends or issues requiring action

### Journey 2: Export for Presentation
1. Sales manager prepares for leadership meeting
2. Configures dashboard filters for relevant data
3. Clicks "Export to PDF"
4. Downloads formatted report
5. Shares with leadership team

## Functional Requirements

### Data Display
- Display daily sales totals by region
- Show top 10 products by revenue
- Display conversion rates and sales trends
- Provide year-over-year comparison

- Drill-down capability for detailed views

### Export & Sharing
- Export to PDF (formatted for presentation)
- Export to Excel (raw data)
- Schedule automated email delivery
- Share dashboard links with permissions

## Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance**: Dashboard load time < 3 seconds

- **Availability**: 99.5% uptime during business hours

## Acceptance Criteria (Feature Level)
- [ ] Dashboard displays accurate real-time sales data
- [ ] All filtering options work correctly
- [ ] Export to PDF generates formatted report
- [ ] Performance meets <3 second load time requirement
- [ ] Mobile view works on tablets
