# Validate Prompt

Please perform comprehensive validation of a prompt file against Prompt Registry format requirements and quality standards.

**Pattern**: Multi-Level Validation Pattern ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐  
**Effectiveness**: Essential for ensuring prompt quality and standards compliance  
**Use When**: Before committing new prompts, after changes, or for quality audits

---

## Purpose

This prompt checks prompts for format compliance, naming conventions, quality standards, and best practices. Use this before committing new prompts or after making changes to ensure they meet all requirements.

Provides:
- Objective pass/fail determination
- Weighted quality scoring across 4 levels
- Specific fix recommendations with examples
- Prioritized issues (errors before warnings)

---

## Required Context

- **Prompt File**: Path to `.prompt.md` file to validate
- **Validation Standards**: Access to prompt creation and registry integration rules
- **YAML Parser**: Ability to parse and validate YAML frontmatter

---

## Process

Follow these steps to validate a prompt:

### Step 1: Parse Prompt File
Load and parse the prompt file including frontmatter and content.

### Step 2: Check Format Compliance
Validate YAML frontmatter structure and required fields (Level 1).

### Step 3: Check Naming Conventions
Verify filename matches name field and follows kebab-case (Level 2).

### Step 4: Assess Quality Standards
Check description quality, tags, content structure (Level 3).

### Step 5: Evaluate Best Practices
Review reusability, OPSEC, related references (Level 4).

### Step 6: Calculate Score and Generate Report
Compute weighted score, determine status, provide recommendations.

## Reasoning Process (for AI Agent)

Before validating, the AI should:

1. **Parse Structure**: Can the file be parsed correctly? Is YAML frontmatter valid?
2. **Check Required Elements**: Are all mandatory fields present (`name`, `description`)?
3. **Assess Quality**: Does it meet quality standards across 4 levels?
4. **Prioritize Issues**: Errors before warnings before suggestions (ERR
OR > WARNING > INFO)
5. **Calculate Score**: Weight checks appropriately (40% format, 20% naming, 30% quality, 10% best practices)
6. **Determine Status**: PASS (≥90%, zero errors), WARNING (70-89% or warnings only), FAIL (<70% or has errors)

## Quality Score Calculation

**Scoring Method**:
- Each validation level has weighted checks
- **Level 1 (Format)**: Critical - 40% weight (frontmatter, required fields)
- **Level 2 (Naming)**: Important - 20% weight (kebab-case, descriptive)
- **Level 3 (Quality)**: Important - 30% weight (description, tags, content)
- **Level 4 (Best Practices)**: Nice-to-have - 10% weight (reusability, OPSEC, references)

**Status Determination**:
- **PASS**: Score ≥ 90%, zero errors
- **WARNING**: Score 70-89% OR has warnings but no errors
- **FAIL**: Score < 70% OR has any errors

## Validation Checklist

### Level 1: Format Compliance (REQUIRED - 40% weight)
