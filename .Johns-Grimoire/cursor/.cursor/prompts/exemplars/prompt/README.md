# Prompt Exemplars Index

This directory contains **exemplar** files - concrete examples of exceptional quality extracted from high-quality prompts. Exemplars demonstrate excellence and serve as reference standards.

## What is an Exemplar?

An **exemplar** is a concrete reference example that:
- Demonstrates exceptional implementation quality
- Shows best practices in action
- Serves as reference standard for similar work
- Focuses on SPECIFIC CONTENT demonstrating excellence
- Explains WHY it's exemplary (learning points)

**Exemplar vs Templar**: Exemplars are concrete examples; templars are abstract templates.

## Quality Scoring

Exemplars are evaluated on:

| Dimension | Weight | Description |
|---|----|----|
| **Clarity** | 20% | How clearly the content communicates |
| **Completeness** | 20% | How thoroughly it covers the topic |
| **Examples** | 20% | Quality and completeness of examples |
| **Reusability** | 20% | How easily patterns can be applied elsewhere |
| **Innovation** | 20% | Novel approaches or exceptional execution |

**Scores**:
- **90-100**: Exceptional (reference standard)
- **80-89**: Excellent (worth studying)
- **70-79**: Good (solid implementation)
- **<70**: Not exemplar quality

## When to Reference Exemplars

### By Documentation Need

| Need | Recommended Exemplar |
|---|---|
| Multi-step guided workflows | Guided Creation Workflow |
| Comprehensive documentation | Comprehensive Documentation |
| Decision support patterns | Both (complementary) |
| Before/after transformations | Comprehensive Documentation |
| Template design | Guided Creation Workflow |

### By Learning Goal

**To learn**:
- **Decision tree design** → Both exemplars show patterns
- **Few-Shot example structure** → Comprehensive Documentation
- **Progressive disclosure** → Guided Creation Workflow
- **Troubleshooting sections** → Comprehensive Documentation
- **Template design** → Guided Creation Workflow

### Step 2: Study Exemplar
Read the "Why This is Exemplary" section to understand excellence criteria.

### Step 3: Review Key Elements
Examine specific patterns demonstrated with high ratings (⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐).

### Step 4: Extract Pattern
Identify the structural pattern you want to apply.

## Learning from Exemplars

### Pattern: Few-Shot Examples

**From**: Comprehensive Documentation Exemplar

**Structure**:
```markdown
### Example 1: [Scenario] (Complete Workflow)
**Request**: [User request]
**Step 1**: [Decisions made]
**Step 2**: [Actions taken]
[...all steps...]
**Final Output**: [Result]
```

**Apply**: Show ENTIRE workflow, not fragments. Include reasoning.

### Pattern: Decision Trees

**From**: Both Exemplars

**Structure**:
```
[Question]?
├─ [Condition A] → [Action A]
├─ [Condition B] → [Action B]
└─ [Condition C] → [Action C]
```

**Apply**: Visual structure for complex choices. Cover all branches.

### Pattern: Before/After Comparison

**From**: Comprehensive Documentation Exemplar

**Structure**:
```markdown
**Before**: [Initial state]
**Analysis**: 
- **Strengths**: [Good parts]
- **Gaps**: [Missing parts]

**After**: [Improved state]
**Impact**: 
- **Quality**: ⬆️ X%
```

**Apply**: Show transformation with quantified impact.

## Exemplar Anti-Patterns

### What Makes Something NOT Exemplary

❌ **Incomplete Examples**
- Showing only highlights, not complete workflows
- Leaving user to "figure out the rest"

❌ **Vague Guidance**
- "Choose the appropriate option" without criteria
- No decision support provided

❌ **Abstract Placeholders**
- `[Your content here]` without structure
- No concrete examples to learn from

❌ **Missing Reasoning**
- Steps without explanation of WHY
- No decision rationale provided

## Contributing New Exemplars

To add a new exemplar:

1. **Identify exceptional quality** in existing prompts
2. **Document WHAT makes it exceptional** (specific elements)
3. **Explain WHY it's exemplary** (learning points)
4. **Rate quality dimensions** (clarity, completeness, etc.)
5. **Provide usage guidance** (when to reference, how to apply)
6. **Add to this index** with summary

**Quality Bar**: Only prompts scoring ≥90/100 should become exemplars.

See `extract-templar-exemplar.prompt.md` for extraction guidance.

## Exemplar vs Source Prompt

**Source Prompt**: The actual working prompt file  
**Exemplar**: Documentation explaining WHY it's exceptional and HOW to learn from it

**Relationship**: Exemplars reference source prompts but add meta-analysis explaining excellence.
