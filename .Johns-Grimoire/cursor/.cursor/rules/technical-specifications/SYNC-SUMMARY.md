# Technical Specifications Rules Sync Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the updates made to sync all technical specification rules with the new hybrid documentation architecture approach.

## Rules Updated

### ✅ **README.md** - UPDATED
- Added reference to new Hybrid Documentation Architecture Rule
- Updated documentation strategy section to reflect layered approach
- Added explanation of database vs domain layer separation

### ✅ **domain-object-rule.mdc** - UPDATED
- Updated file location to `docs/technical/[domain]/domain/domain-objects/[entity-name]-domain-object.md`
- Added folder structure integration diagram
- Updated file naming examples to reflect new path structure
- Added context about layered architecture integration

### ✅ **enumeration-rule.mdc** - UPDATED
- Updated file location to `docs/technical/[domain]/domain/enumerations/[enum-name]-enum.md`
- Added folder structure integration diagram
- Updated file naming examples to reflect new path structure
- Maintained requirement for source C++ enum reference

### ✅ **entity-relationship-rule.mdc** - UPDATED
- Added clarification that this rule applies to database layer documentation
- Added file location context showing integration with 3-file database pattern
- Clarified relationship to schema and constraints files

### ✅ **domain-overview-rule.mdc** - UPDATED
- Added file location context at domain root level
- Updated cross-reference navigation to include database and domain layers
- Added layered architecture navigation template
- Enhanced stakeholder navigation (developers, DBAs, architects)

### ✅ **hybrid-documentation-architecture-rule.mdc** - CREATED
- New comprehensive rule defining the complete hybrid approach
- Database layer: 3-file pattern
- Domain layer: DDD pattern with separate folders
- Domain-by-domain implementation strategy
- Clear separation of concerns and responsibilities

## Rules Needing Manual Updates

### ⚠️ **business-rules-rule.mdc** - NEEDS UPDATE
**Issue**: Multiple identical strings prevented automated update
**Required Changes**:
- Add file location section showing placement at domain root
- Clarify that business rules span both database and domain layers
- Update to show integration with layered architecture

### ⚠️ **integration-points-rule.mdc** - NEEDS UPDATE
**Required Changes**:
- Add file location section showing placement at domain root
- Clarify relationship to external system interfaces across layers
- Update to show integration with layered architecture

### **Rule Application Map**
- **hybrid-documentation-architecture-rule**: Overall structure and approach
- **domain-overview-rule**: Domain root navigation file
- **business-rules-rule**: Domain root business logic file  
- **integration-points-rule**: Domain root external interfaces file
- **entity-relationship-rule**: Database layer schema and constraints files
- **domain-object-rule**: Domain layer individual entity files
- **enumeration-rule**: Domain layer individual enumeration files

## Benefits Achieved

### ✅ **Clear Separation of Concerns**
- Database technical details separated from domain business logic
- Each rule has clear scope and application area
- No overlap or confusion between rule applications

### ✅ **Layered Architecture Support**
- Clean Architecture principles supported
- Domain-Driven Design patterns enabled
- Infrastructure vs Domain layer distinction clear

### ✅ **Domain-by-Domain Implementation**
- Complete domain documentation in single folder
- Parallel team development supported
- Clear ownership and boundaries

### ✅ **Migration Optimization**
- Database layer provides technical migration foundation
- Domain layer provides business logic preservation
- Clear separation enables focused development efforts

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Manual Updates**: Update business-rules-rule and integration-points-rule
2. **Validate Consistency**: Review all rules for consistent terminology and approach
3. **Update Examples**: Create exemplar files demonstrating new structure
4. **Team Communication**: Communicate new structure to documentation teams

This sync ensures all technical specification rules work together cohesively to support the hybrid documentation architecture approach.
