# Cross-Domain Invocation Strategies Validation Report

**Generated**: 2025-11-04
**Validated Against**: `rule.authoring.invocation-strategies.v1`
**Domains Validated**: rule-authoring, agile, migration, technical-specifications, ticket
**Status**: ❌ **WIDESPREAD NON-COMPLIANCE**

## Executive Summary

Validated **47 rule files** across **5 domains** against invocation strategies framework.

### Critical Findings

1. **✅ GOOD NEWS**: Agent-application rules correctly use Strategy 2 (omit globs/governs)
2. **❌ BAD NEWS**: Only **2 out of 47 rules (4%)** have the `alwaysApply` field
3. **❌ CRITICAL**: 45 rules (96%) are missing required `alwaysApply` field

### Compliance Summary

| Domain | Total Rules | Agent-App Rules | Has alwaysApply | Compliance Rate |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| rule-authoring | 11 | 1 | 0 | 0% |
| agile | 6 | 1 | 0 | 0% |
| migration | 5 | 0 | 0 | 0% |
| technical-specifications | 11 | 1 | 0 | 0% |
| ticket | 14 | 1 | 2 | 14% |
| **TOTAL** | **47** | **4** | **2** | **4%** |

## Detailed Validation Results

### Strategy Classification

According to `rule.authoring.invocation-strategies.v1`:

- **Strategy 1** (File-Mask Triggered): Operational rules with globs/governs, alwaysApply: false

## Consolidated Statistics

### Overall Compliance

| Metric | Count | Percentage |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Total Rules Validated | 47 | 100% |
| Rules Using Strategy 1 (File-Mask) | 43 | 91.5% |
| Rules Using Strategy 2 (Agentic) | 4 | 8.5% |
| Rules Using Strategy 3 (Always-Apply) | 0 | 0% |
| **Rules with alwaysApply field** | **2** | **4%** |
| **Rules missing alwaysApply field** | **45** | **96%** |

### Strategy Compliance

| Strategy | Rules | Correct Structure | Missing alwaysApply | Structure Rate | Field Rate |
|----------|-------|-------------------|---------------------|----------------|------------|
| Strategy 1 | 43 | 43 (100%) | 41 (95%) | ✅ 100% | ❌ 5% |
| Strategy 2 | 4 | 4 (100%) | 4 (100%) | ✅ 100% | ❌ 0% |
| **Overall** | **47** | **47 (100%)** | **45 (96%)** | ✅ **100%** | ❌ **4%** |

### Key Observations

1. **✅ Strategy Selection**: All rules correctly chose Strategy 1 or 2
2. **✅ globs/governs**: All Strategy 1 rules have globs/governs
3. **✅ Omission**: All Strategy 2 rules correctly omit globs/governs
4. **❌ alwaysApply**: Almost universally missing (45/47 rules)

---

## Root Cause Analysis

### Why This Happened

1. **Historical**: Rules created before `rule.authoring.invocation-strategies.v1` existed
2. **New Requirement**: `alwaysApply` is a new field added by invocation strategies rule
3. **Not Retroactively Applied**: When invocation-strategies rule was created, existing rules weren't updated
4. **Inconsistent Base Spec**: `rule.authoring.file-structure.v1` lists 10 fields, doesn't include `alwaysApply`
5. **Partial Adoption**: Only ticket domain shows evidence of awareness (2 rules have it)

### Timeline Inference

Based on evidence:
1. **Phase 1**: Rules created with 10-field front-matter (no alwaysApply)
2. **Phase 2**: Invocation strategies rule created, introduced alwaysApply concept
3. **Phase 3**: Ticket domain partially updated (2 rules got alwaysApply)
4. **Phase 4**: Other domains not updated yet

---

## Impact Assessment

### Functional Impact: ⚠️ MEDIUM

**Currently**:
- Rules still function (Cursor likely defaults alwaysApply to false)
- Invocation behavior is IMPLICIT, not EXPLICIT
- Risk if Cursor default behavior changes

**Potential Issues**:
- Unclear whether rule should auto-trigger or require explicit invocation
- Tool implementers must guess intended behavior
- Future Cursor versions might interpret missing field differently

### Compliance Impact: ❌ HIGH

**Framework Integrity**:
- Rules don't follow their own standards (invocation-strategies.v1)
- Framework lacks self-consistency across domains
- Validation reports in some domains claimed "PASS" but missed this

**Credibility**:
- If our rules don't follow our framework, why should others?
- Undermines authority of rule-authoring standards

### Maintenance Impact: ⚠️ MEDIUM

**Consistency**:
- New rules might be created without alwaysApply (no clear standard)
- Inconsistent patterns across domains
- Harder to validate rules programmatically

**Documentation**:
- Examples in validation reports show alwaysApply
- But actual rule files don't have it (confusing for learners)

## Recommended Remediation

### ✅ Recommended Approach: Systematic Update

#### Phase 1: Update file-structure.v1 (Foundation)

**File**: `.cursor/rules/rule-authoring/rule-file-structure.mdc`

**Action**: Add `alwaysApply` as 11th required field

**Current Canonical Schema** (10 fields):
```yaml
---
id: rule.[domain].[action].v[major]
kind: rule | templar | exemplar
version: [semver]
description: [one sentence]
globs: ["**/[pattern]"]
governs: ["**/[pattern]"]
implements: [action]
requires: []
model_hints: { temp: 0.2, top_p: 0.9 }
provenance: { owner: [team], last_review: [date] }
---
```

**Updated Canonical Schema** (11 fields):
```yaml
---
id: rule.[domain].[action].v[major]
kind: rule | templar | exemplar
version: [semver]
description: [one sentence]
globs: ["**/[pattern]"]
governs: ["**/[pattern]"]
implements: [action]
requires: []
model_hints: { temp: 0.2, top_p: 0.9 }
provenance: { owner: [team], last_review: [date] }
alwaysApply: false  # NEW: Explicit invocation control
---
```

**Placement**: After `provenance`, before closing `---`

**Rationale**: Makes invocation behavior explicit, aligns with invocation-strategies.v1

**Version Impact**: MINOR bump (1.0.0 → 1.1.0) - backward-compatible addition

#### Phase 2: Update All Rules by Domain

For each domain, update all rule files:

**For Strategy 1 Rules (Operational - 43 rules)**:
```yaml
alwaysApply: false  # Add after provenance field
```

**For Strategy 2 Rules (Agent-Application - 4 rules)**:
```yaml
alwaysApply: false  # Add after provenance field
```

**Version Impact**: PATCH bump (x.y.z → x.y.z+1) for each rule
**Rationale**: Non-behavioral change (makes existing implicit behavior explicit)

#### Domain-by-Domain Breakdown

| Domain | Rules to Update | Effort Estimate |
|--------|-----------------|-----------------|
| rule-authoring | 11 files | 15 minutes |
| agile | 6 files | 10 minutes |
| migration | 5 files | 8 minutes |
| technical-specifications | 11 files | 15 minutes |
| ticket | 12 files (exclude 2 already done) | 15 minutes |
| **TOTAL** | **45 files** | **~60 minutes** |

#### Phase 3: Update Validation Reports

Update validation reports to reflect compliance:
- `INVOCATION-STRATEGIES-VALIDATION.md` (already created)
- `.cursor/rules/rule-authoring/VALIDATION-REPORT.md`
- `.cursor/rules/technical-specifications/VALIDATION-REPORT-FINAL.md`
- Other domain validation reports as needed

**Effort**: 15 minutes

---

## Alternative Approaches (Not Recommended)

### ❌ Option B: Make alwaysApply Optional

Make `alwaysApply` optional with implicit default of `false`.

**Against**:
- Violates "Explicit Over Implicit" principle
- Creates ambiguity
- Harder to audit and validate
- Doesn't align with invocation-strategies rule

### ❌ Option C: Do Nothing

Accept current state, document that alwaysApply is "implied false" when missing.

**Against**:
- Perpetuates non-compliance
- Framework lacks credibility
- Confusing for new rule authors
- Risk if tooling changes

---

## Implementation Priority

### Priority: HIGH

**Rationale**:
1. Framework self-consistency is critical
2. Affects all domains (not isolated to one)
3. Relatively low effort (60 minutes for 45 files)
4. Prevents future confusion and errors

### Suggested Timeline

**Immediate** (Next working session):
- Update file-structure.v1 to 11 fields
- Update rule-authoring domain (11 rules)

**Short-term** (This week):
- Update agile domain (6 rules)
- Update migration domain (5 rules)
- Update technical-specifications domain (11 rules)
- Update ticket domain (12 rules)

**Follow-up**:
- Update validation reports
- Document lessons learned
- Create automated validation script to prevent future drift

---

## Lessons Learned

### What Went Right ✅

1. **Strategy Selection**: All rules correctly chose Strategy 1 or 2
2. **Agent-Application Pattern**: All 4 agent-application rules correctly omit globs/governs
3. **Partial Evidence**: Ticket domain shows awareness (2 rules have alwaysApply)
4. **Validation Caught It**: User asked for validation, found widespread issue before it spread further

### What Went Wrong ❌

1. **No Retroactive Update**: When invocation-strategies rule was created, existing rules weren't updated
2. **Base Spec Outdated**: file-structure.v1 still lists 10 fields, doesn't include alwaysApply
3. **Validation Gap**: Multiple validation reports claimed "PASS" without checking this field
4. **Cross-Domain Drift**: Different domains evolved independently without synchronization

### How to Prevent Future Issues ✅

1. **When Adding Required Fields**:
   - Update file-structure.v1 canonical schema FIRST
   - Then retroactively apply to ALL existing rules
   - Update ALL domain validation reports
   
2. **Cross-Domain Synchronization**:
   - When one domain updates, check if change applies to others
   - Maintain consistency across all domains
   - Regular cross-domain audits
   
3. **Automated Validation**:
   - Create validation script checking front-matter completeness
   - Run against all domains periodically
   - Block rule PRs that don't pass validation
   
4. **Documentation**:
   - Keep file-structure.v1 as single source of truth
   - All examples must match current canonical schema
   - Validation reports must be comprehensive

## Comparison to Earlier Discussion

**Earlier Today**: We rejected academic proposals for adding:
- `authorized_agents`, `delegation_mode`, `modifies`, `audit`, `manual_only`, `rationale`, `impact`

**We said**: "Don't add fields without demonstrated need."

**But `alwaysApply`**:
- ✅ Comes from our practice (invocation-strategies rule we created)
- ✅ Solves real architectural ambiguity (when does rule trigger?)
- ✅ Is minimal (single boolean field)
- ✅ Is necessary (distinguishes Strategy 1/2/3)
- ✅ Already documented in our own framework

**This validates our approach**: 
- ✅ Add fields extracted from practice (alwaysApply)
- ❌ Reject fields from academic theory (authorized_agents, etc.)

**The irony**: We correctly identified that we need `alwaysApply`, but haven't finished implementing it!

---

## Final Verdict

**Status**: ❌ **WIDESPREAD NON-COMPLIANCE**

**Compliance Rate**: 4% (2/47 rules have alwaysApply)

**Recommendation**: **Implement Systematic Update (Phase 1-3)**

**Effort**: ~75 minutes total
- 15 min: Update file-structure.v1
- 60 min: Update 45 rule files
- 15 min: Update validation reports

**Priority**: **HIGH**

**Urgency**: **Moderate** (not blocking, but important for framework integrity)

**Impact**: **Improves consistency, clarity, and compliance across all domains**
