# Business Feature BF-001: Configuration Data Extraction

## Feature Header
- **Feature ID**: BF-001
- **Feature Title**: Extract Configuration Data from EBASE Environments
- **Epic**: EPP-192 - Standard Configuration Management
- **Status**: In Progress
- **Priority**: High
- **Business Value**: High
- **Created**: 2025-01-15
- **Last Updated**: 2025-01-20

## Business Context

### Business Problem
System administrators need to extract configuration data from different EBASE environments to analyze, compare, and backup core configuration data for standardization purposes. Currently:
- No standardized extraction process exists
- Manual extraction is time-consuming and error-prone
- Configuration comparisons are difficult
- Backup and restore processes are inconsistent

### User Need
As a system administrator, I need to extract configuration data in various formats so that I can perform analysis and ensure consistency across environments.

### Business Value
- **Enables Configuration Standardization**: Provides the foundation for comparing and aligning configurations across environments
- **Reduces Manual Effort**: Automates what was previously a manual, time-consuming process
- **Provides Foundation for Comparison**: Creates the baseline data needed for configuration comparison and backup
- **Improves Auditability**: Creates documented snapshots of configuration state

### Success Metrics
- Configuration data can be extracted from all 11 core tables within 5 minutes
- Data is exported in multiple formats (Excel, JSON, CSV, SQL) with 100% accuracy
- Extraction process is automated and reliable (99% success rate)
- 80% reduction in time spent on manual configuration extraction
