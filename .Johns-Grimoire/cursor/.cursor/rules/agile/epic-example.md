# Epic EPP-192: Standard Configuration Management

## Epic Header
- **Epic ID**: EPP-192
- **Epic Title**: Standard Configuration NL Power for EBASE System Tables
- **Status**: In Progress
- **Priority**: High
- **Created**: 2025-01-15
- **Last Updated**: 2025-01-20

## Business Context

### Problem Statement
Tier 1 BRP customers need split EBASE environments for market standard processes and business custom processes. Currently, there is no standardized way to manage core system configuration tables across different environments, leading to:
- Configuration drift between environments
- Inconsistent behavior across installations
- Difficult troubleshooting and support
- Complex environment setup and maintenance

### Business Value
- **Reduced Complexity**: Customers can rely on consistent standard configurations
- **Improved Data Consistency**: All environments start from the same baseline
- **Better Separation of Concerns**: Clear distinction between standard and custom configurations
- **Faster Time to Value**: New environments can be bootstrapped quickly
- **Lower Support Costs**: Fewer configuration-related support tickets

### Success Metrics
- All environments have consistent bootstrapped configurations
- Zero configuration drift between standard environments
- 50% reduction in configuration-related support tickets
- New environment setup time reduced from 2 days to 4 hours
- 100% of 11 core tables covered by standard configuration

- **Database**: MSSQL Server with Dapper ORM
- **Export Formats**: Excel (EPPlus), JSON (System.Text.Json), CSV
- **CLI**: Command-line interface for automation
- **API**: REST API for integration

### Integration Points
- **EBASE Database**: Direct database access for configuration tables
- **File System**: For template storage and export files
- **Version Control**: Git for template versioning
- **CI/CD**: Integration with deployment pipelines

### Data Requirements
- **Source Data**: EBASE configuration tables (11 core tables)
- **Template Storage**: File-based templates in Git repository
- **Audit Data**: Change tracking and audit logs
- **Export Files**: Excel/JSON/CSV output files

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks

#### 1. Database Schema Changes
- **Risk**: Configuration table schemas may change between versions
- **Impact**: High - Could break extraction/update logic
- **Probability**: Medium
- **Mitigation**: 
  - Schema versioning and compatibility checks
  - Automated schema validation
  - Support for multiple schema versions

#### 2. Performance Impact
- **Risk**: Large configuration tables may cause performance issues
- **Impact**: Medium - Could slow down extraction/comparison
- **Probability**: Medium
- **Mitigation**:
  - Batch processing for large tables
  - Performance optimization and indexing
  - Parallel processing where possible

#### 3. Integration Complexity
- **Risk**: Complex relationships between tables may be difficult to handle
- **Impact**: High - Could result in incomplete or invalid configurations
