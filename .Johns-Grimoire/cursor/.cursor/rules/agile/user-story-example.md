# User Story US-001: Extract Configuration Data

## Story Header
- **Story ID**: US-001
- **Story Title**: Extract Configuration Data from EBASE Environments
- **Feature**: TF-001 - Data Extraction Engine
- **Epic**: EPP-192 - Standard Configuration Management
- **Status**: In Progress
- **Priority**: High
- **Story Points**: 8
- **Created**: 2025-01-15
- **Last Updated**: 2025-01-20

## User Story

### Main Story
**As a** system administrator  
**I want to** extract bootstrapped configuration data from different EBASE environments in various formats  
**So that** I can analyze, compare, and backup core configuration data for standardization purposes

### User Type
- **Primary User**: System Administrator
  - Responsible for environment configuration and maintenance
  - Needs to ensure consistency across environments
  - Performs configuration backup and restore operations
  
- **Secondary Users**: 
  - **Data Analyst**: Uses extracted data for analysis and reporting
  - **Configuration Manager**: Manages configuration templates and standards

### Business Value
- **Enables Configuration Standardization**: Provides the data foundation needed to compare and align configurations across different EBASE environments
- **Reduces Manual Effort**: Automates what was previously a manual, time-consuming process of extracting configuration data
- **Provides Foundation for Comparison**: Creates the baseline data needed for configuration comparison and validation features
- **Supports Compliance and Audit**: Creates documented snapshots of configuration state for compliance and audit purposes
- **Reduces Risk**: Enables configuration backup and restore capabilities, reducing risk of configuration loss

## Acceptance Criteria

### Given-When-Then Format

#### Scenario 1: Extract all configuration tables
**Given** I have access to an EBASE environment with proper credentials  
**When** I run the extraction process for all 11 bootstrapped configuration tables  
**Then** I receive data in the selected format (Excel, JSON, CSV, SQL)  
**And** the data includes all records from the specified tables  
**And** the data includes metadata (timestamp, environment name, table structure)  
**And** the extraction completes within 5 minutes for up to 10,000 records per table

#### Scenario 2: Extract specific table with filtering
**Given** I have access to an EBASE environment  
**When** I run the extraction process for a specific table with filtering criteria (e.g., WHERE Switch = 1)  
**Then** I receive only the filtered data in the selected format  
**And** the filtering criteria are correctly applied (verified by record count)  
**And** the filtered data matches what I would get from a manual SQL query

#### Scenario 3: Handle large datasets
**Given** I have access to an EBASE environment with large datasets (>10,000 records)  
**When** I run the extraction process  
**Then** the process completes successfully without memory issues  
**And** progress is reported every second throughout the extraction  
**And** the process can be cancelled at any time without leaving incomplete files  
**And** memory usage stays under 500MB

#### Scenario 4: Handle connection failures
**Given** I am extracting data from an EBASE environment  
**When** a database connection failure occurs during extraction  
**Then** the system retries the operation up to 3 times with exponential backoff  
**And** if all retries fail, I receive a clear error message indicating the connection problem  
**And** any partially extracted data is cleaned up

#### Scenario 5: Export in multiple formats simultaneously
**Given** I have access to an EBASE environment  
**When** I select multiple export formats (e.g., Excel, JSON, CSV)  
**Then** the system exports the data in all selected formats  
**And** all format files contain the same data  
**And** each format is properly structured and valid
